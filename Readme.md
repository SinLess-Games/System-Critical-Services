## Services Overview

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each containing configuration files and documentation for a specific set of services:

- **[Management](management/README.md):**  
  Contains services such as GitLab, databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and related management tools.

- **[Networking](networking/README.md):**  
  Contains configurations for DNS services (PowerDNS, dnsdist), VPN (WireGuard), load balancers (Traefik, Nginx), and network controllers (Unifi).

- **[Observability](observability/README.md):**  
  Contains configurations for monitoring and logging tools like Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and exporters.

- **[Setup](setup/README.md):**  
  Contains scripts and Dockerfiles for building and initializing the overall system.

Each service is containerized using Docker Compose, and sensitive credentials are managed via `.env` files (or `.env.example` files for reference).  
For more details about each serviceâ€™s configuration and deployment, please refer to the corresponding README files in each subdirectory.
