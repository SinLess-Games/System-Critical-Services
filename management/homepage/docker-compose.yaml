# Docker Compose configuration for the Homepage application
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:
# â€¢ Use "docker compose up" (not "docker stack deploy") to run this file.
#   There is a known bug in stack deploy that prevents inter-service communication.
#
# This configuration connects the Homepage container to two external networks:
#  - "frontend": intended for public traffic.
#  - "backend": for internal service communications.
#
# The container is configured to expose port 3000 to the external world.
# Environment variables are used to inject credentials and URLs for external services.
